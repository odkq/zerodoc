Example zerodoc document

This is an example zerodoc document. See `it's source code` to
learn by example.

This first two paragraphs are the 'abstract'

- 1. Text format
- 2. Diagrams
- 3. Links

1. TEXT FORMAT

Text is organized into paragraphs. No line can exceed 72 chars in
regular text. Lines with more than that can be defined by using back\
slash (\) at the end of the line

- List items
 - Can be defined
 - and nested
- this way. You can have serveral lines for
  a single list item, as long as they are
  indented properly

deflist
    definition for keyword. It can spawn several lines
    on itself

 int main(void)
 {
        printf('Hello, world, this is source code\n');
 }

2. DIAGRAMS

You can draw diagrams using three different tools by default
in zerodoc:

Ditaa diagrams:

  +---------------+                +--------------------+

tikz diagrams:

  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
    \draw [<->,thick] (0,2) node (yaxis) [above] {$y$}
        |- (3,0) node (xaxis) [right] {$x$};
    \draw (0,0) coordinate (a_1) -- (2,1.8) coordinate (a_2);
    \draw (0,1.5) coordinate (b_1) -- (2.5,0) coordinate (b_2);
    \coordinate (c) at (intersection of a_1--a_2 and b_1--b_2);
    \draw[dashed] (yaxis |- c) node[left] {$y'$}
        -| (xaxis -| c) node[below] {$x'$};
    \fill[red] (c) circle (2pt);
  \end{tikzpicture}

gnuplot:

  (not really yet)

Source code blocks and diagrams do not have the 72 char limitation,
(anyway it is advised to keep it to make it easier for diffing/email
etc)

3. LINKS

`Links` are defined as references wich are resolved later
or `directly`:http://www.google.com in the text. `Zerodoc`
showcase stops here

- `Links`:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link
- `Zerodoc`:http://odkq.com/zerodoc
- `it's source code`:example.0
