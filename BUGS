Current unresolved bugs in the zerodoc parser

Abstract

- Default Zerodoc schema makes abstract mandatory

DEFAULT ZERODOC SCHEMA MAKES ABSTRACT MANDATORY

No document without abstract/toc can be defined. Could we define
the default format as not having title? How can we distinguish
between a first paragraph and the title if we allow for multiline
titles and one-line paragraphs?

HANDLE CONTINUATION LINES AND LINE LENGTH LIMITS

This is perhaps easier to do in a pre-ply processing of input
