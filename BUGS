DEFAULT ZERODOC SCHEMA MAKES ABSTRACT MANDATORY

No document without abstract/toc can be defined. Could we define
the default format as not having title? How can we distinguish
between a first paragraph and the title if we allow for multiline
titles and one-line paragraphs?

TODO: links

Define and implement a consistent format for links that allows both
referenced (wikipedia, rfc's) links and direct on-text ones.

TODO: attributes

Implement a way to represent text attributes in the parsed tree
Thought on extending the dictionary

TODO: HTML output finish

Finish HTML support for described format with diagrams and images

TODO: Templates/schemas support

Add support for schemas with a format that both define top-level
syntax rules like document : header body, etc and some lexical
limitations like line lengths and such (for git commit comments)

TODO: manpage support with 'linkback'

Not only manpage format output, but a way to include a certain
part of a document to be a manual page, and _reference_ inside
that part the rest (To include zerodoc text format description
in the manual page, but *after* explaining the zerodoc command
line program in the regular manpage way)

TODO: markdown/confluence output support

TODO: asciidoc output

TODO: ReST output

For the pretty Sphinx
