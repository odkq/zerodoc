Current unresolved bugs in the zerodoc parser

Abstract

- List inside source code
- Default Zerodoc schema makes abstract mandatory

LIST INSIDE SOURCE CODE

When defining a list inside source code, as a nested list have
spaces, it is wrongly recognized as list. The best way I think
to fix this is define a 'listlines' block as starting with a
special 'firstline' terminal defined by '- text\n'

DEFAULT ZERODOC SCHEMA MAKES ABSTRACT MANDATORY

No document without abstract/toc can be defined. Could we define
the default format as not having title? How can we distinguish
between a first paragraph and the title if we allow for multiline
titles and one-line paragraphs?
